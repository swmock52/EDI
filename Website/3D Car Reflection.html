</head>

  <a href="index.html"><h2>HOME</h2></a>

<p>This is a reflection of the work I did with 3D modeling. I created a 3D model and 3D print of a toy car to scale. The goal was to accurately represent the toy car I chose.</p>



<h2 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Guidelines</h3> 

<p>For this project, I was instructed to consider the X, Y, and Z planes in a 3D form. The profile from each point of view will define the car shape. Using CAD (computer-aided drafting) to define the shape of the car in 2D and extrude the shape, I created a 3D form.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li> 
<li>Design car in a 1:1 ratio</li>
<li>Size accuracy ±1%</li>
<li>Design is exported as STL</li>
<li>Orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support materials</li>
<li>File is exported as a GCODE</li>
<li>Final design is shared as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage</li>
</ul>




<h2 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Steps/Process</h3> 

<p>Scaling and Drawing</p>
<ul>
<li>Once I selected a suitable toy car to replicate, I used calipers to take its specific measurements. With the measurements, I drew the toy car to scale as an engineering drawing. I scanned my engineering drawing onto my computer and continued working using OnShape.</li>
</ul>



<p>3D Modeling</p>
<ul>
<li>In OnShape, I drew each profile (using/referencing my engineering drawing) on each plane side. Once I drew each outline on each plane, I used the extrusion tool to remove the negative spaces from the 3D form.</li>
<li>To add additional details to my 3D model, I used the extrusion and fillet tools to create extruding wheels and a window.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slicing and Printing</p>
<ul>

<li>When my 3D model was complete, I imported the design into Cura to make the final scaling changes. I positioned the 3D model on the build plate to minimize support material and set the nozzle to 0.6mm. I noticed that the bottom of my 3D model needed support, so I quickly adjusted the level of support in Cura settings. I exported the file as a GCODE and printed the model using the 3D printer</li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation</p>
<ul>
<li>To document my process, I periodically uploaded screenshots and documents to my GitHub page. When my 3D car printed, I created a CAD drawing with a margin of error analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Setbacks and Solutions</h3> 
<p>The first setback I experienced occurred during the drawing and 3D modeling stages. I didn't notice until after uploading my engineering drawing into OnShape that my dimensions were incorrect. I went back to the toy car and remeasured it using the calipers. Instead of adjusting the dimensions in OnShape, I went back to my engineering drawing and adjusted it on paper, then re-loaded the phone </p>

<p>The second minor setback I experienced occurred during the slicing and printing stages. When I uploaded my 3D model into Cura, I noticed that my car needed support at the base. So, I went into settings and adjusted the level of support and printed it with a support skirt around the design. </p>
